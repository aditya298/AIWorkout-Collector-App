# AIWorkout-Collector-App
AIWorkout is an app to collect data for Stanford CS229 Project on motion recognization using ML and gyrometer data from an Apple Watch.
The collector sends motion data from your Apple Watch to a server, and the uploaded files can be used for ML model training & testing.

# Instructions To Use

Install app to Apple Watch via Xcode.
Open App.
Select data type: 

Up = Jump, 
Right = Dodge Right,
Down = Duck,
Left = Dodge Left

Tap "Start"
Tap "Record"

Jump, Duck, or Dodge Left & Right, based on the data type you selected.

Tap "Finish"

And it's uploaded!

Access your server via ssh, download the files, and train your motion recognition model!
